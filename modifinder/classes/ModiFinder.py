class ModiFinder:
    """
    Base class for compound network.

    ModiFinder Can be used in two scenarios
    1. between a known and an unknown compound. 
    2. in a network consisting of known and unknown compounds.

    In both scenarios, the ModiFinder object stores a directed graph where the nodes are compounds (known and unknown)
    and edges are directed (from smaller compound to the larger compound) holding the relationships between the pair (alignment, similarity, etc). The object also stores
    the unknown compounds in the network. The object can be used to get information about the unknown compound.

    Parameters
    ----------
    network : nx.DiGraph
        A networkx graph object with the nodes are identified by the compound ids and the "compound"
        attibute of a node is a Compound object. The edges are the relationships between the compounds
        and the "edgedetail" attribute of an edge is an EdgeDetail object.

    unknowns : list
        A list of compound ids that are unknown in the network.
